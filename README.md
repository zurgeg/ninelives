### ~~Frozen Jump Glitch~~ (patched as of v0.0.0-alpha.3)
Pressing a jump key while you are jumping causes the game to block the player from jumping again.

### ~~Random KO Glitch (Regression as of v0.0.0-alpha.5)~~ (patched as of v0.0.0-beta.1)
Its possible for the player to turn the cat into clipping through the floor and KOing themselves. Let's fix this!

The player randomly disappears after rapidly jumping.
