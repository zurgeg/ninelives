### ~~Frozen Jump Glitch~~ (patched as of v0.0.0-alpha.3)
Pressing a jump key while you are jumping causes the game to block the player from jumping again.

### ~~Random KO Glitch (Regression as of v0.0.0-alpha.5)~~ (patched as of v0.0.0-beta.1)
Its possible for the player to turn the cat into clipping through the floor and KOing themselves. Let's fix this!

### Player Disappearing while jumping glitch (regression as of master@8c67c72574069fbdb52a535f44cfe8e8aba8de00)
The player randomly disappears after jumping sometimes.
